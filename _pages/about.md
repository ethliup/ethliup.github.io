Dr. Peidong Liu is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), Hangzhou, China. He obtained his PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/) and [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/). He obtained both his master and bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore. 

His prior research work mainly lies at the intersection of robotics and 3D computer vision, with the applications to robotics, autonomous driving, virtual reality and augmented reality etc. His recent research interests are as follows:
- 3D Computer Vision: visual odometry, vision-based localization, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, 3D generative modeling (i.e., 3D AIGC) etc.;
- 3D Vision+X: interdisciplinary research by applying 3D vision techniques to other areas.
